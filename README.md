# Heart Disease Data Science Mini-Project

**Aim:**  
To explore cardiovascular risk factors using classic data science techniques on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset.

**Summary:**  
I performed data cleaning, visualization (boxplots, pairplots), logistic regression, and K-means clustering to understand how features like blood pressure and maximum heart rate relate to heart disease. MaxHR emerged as the most important predictor, and clustering revealed that these features alone do not form clearly separated patient groups.

**Reflection:**  
This was my first time putting together a full data science workflow on a healthcare dataset. I learned a lot about the strengths and limits of simple models and the value of good data cleaning and visualisation.
